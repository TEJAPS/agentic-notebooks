My name is Sai Teja. I'm a software engineer, trainer and youtuber. 
I'm originally from Hyderabad, India, but I travelled and stayed acorss the country.
I love all veg foods, particularly hot items, 
but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of oil items. 
I want to avoid sweets but seeing the decor and flavour i end up having it more.
